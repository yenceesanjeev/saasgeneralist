I"°<p>Tech #marketing teams of the future should learn from the entertainment industry, not other marketing teams</p>

<p>Product launch video?
Learn from someone whoâ€™s done a movie/game trailer</p>

<p>Podcast?
Learn from a Radio Jockey who knows how to engage an audience with only their voice</p>

<p>Webinar/Conference talk?
Learn from a theatre artist/standup comedian who can engage a crowd for 90 minutes</p>

<p>How-to product video?
Learn from YouTubers with a million subscribers who teach how to dance online</p>

<p>Event?
Learn from industry events like E3 Expo on how to throw a party, not just an event</p>

<p>Product demo video?
Learn from a script writer on how to tell a compelling story for your product</p>

<p>You get the idea. The marketing teams that put on a show will be far more successful in the future</p>

<p>Idea inspired from Dave Gerhardt (ex Drift). He was the first one to focus on â€˜putting on a showâ€™</p>
