I"m<p>The only true constraints are ethical, moral and legal. Everything else exists only inside your head!</p>

<p>“I don’t know enough to try for that role. I’m not ready yet”
“I wish I had an MBA. They will only accept MBA grads”
“I really want to learn that skill but that course/book is just too expensive”
“I don’t know enough. I must learn A, B &amp; C before asking for that opportunity”
“I’ve never done it before, so let me not volunteer for this project”
“The job description says 5+ years experience. I can’t apply!”
“My colleagues won’t teach me! How can I grow?”
“No one listens to my idea. How can I implement it?”
“The HR didn’t call back. I’m not getting that opportunity”
“I’m too young to be a conference speaker.”</p>

<p>Countless other reasons we tell ourselves to not do something.</p>

<p>Inexperienced? Write a convincing cover letter with a portfolio attached and see what happens
Too expensive? Try emailing them and ask for a discount in exchange of a review
No one’s teaching? Sign up for courses, learn it yourself
No one’s listening to your idea? Hire/find a developer to build it
HR didn’t call back? Find the hiring manager on Linkedin
Too young to be a speaker? Apply for that speaking slot anyways</p>

<p>There is always a way. You’ll only see it if you break your imaginary constraint</p>
