I"í<p>Being a Sales Engineer, I spend most of my time demoing. Having demoed so many times, I find it surprising that now I can demo without practice, without effort. Demoing has become like brushing my teeth â€” I get on a call and it happens automatically.</p>

<p>This is when it hit me, Iâ€™m not learning anything new and Iâ€™m certainly not getting better. I decided to take a step back and introspect. This is typically what I do at demos:</p>

<p><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cd78de_7369eb60e45e420e8f54d79f55774238~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_940,h_191,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/cd78de_7369eb60e45e420e8f54d79f55774238~mv2.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once I realised that Iâ€™m blindly following a pattern, I become self aware. I decided to break that pattern and immediately ran into trouble. My demoes werenâ€™t as fluid as they were before as I consciously tried to do things that I wasnâ€™t comfortable with. It broke the flow but that was required. I wasnâ€™t getting any better.</p>

<h1 id="your-demo-was-never-a-demo-of-your-product">Your demo was never a demo of your product</h1>

<p>It took me a while to realize that a â€˜demoâ€™ in the SaaS world is actually not supposed to be a â€˜demoâ€™. A demo here means that you and a prospect are discussing a potential solution(not the product) to their problems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>If your product â€˜demoâ€™ is a superhero movie, then your product is not the hero but only a sidekick.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My demo was a product centric discussion â€” I talk about the product, what it can do(carefully avoiding what it canâ€™t do) and how awesome it is at doing that. Since Iâ€™m the product expert, most of the time itâ€™s just a boring monologue by me.</p>

<p>However, a demo is supposed to be a solutions centric discussion â€”we should discuss a solution to a potential problem. The product may or may not be a part of this conversation.</p>

<p>â€˜Product demoâ€™ is wrongly labelled. If it was up to me, Iâ€™d ban the word and instead call them a â€˜Product conversationâ€™</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-have-this-conversation">How do we have this conversation?</h1>

<p>Iâ€™m the guy my friends and family come to when they want to buy a new phone. Iâ€™m updated on the latest phones and the features they bring. I read tech blogs a lot.</p>

<p>I qualify for the â€˜What phone should I buy next?â€™ because I donâ€™t tell them the BEST phone. I suggest a phone thatâ€™s within their budget and can do most of what they want. If it canâ€™t do anything, I tell them that as well.</p>

<p>Above all, the most important reason is: I care. Iâ€™m genuinely interested in helping them find the right phone. I feel happy when they come back after 2 months of using the phone telling me itâ€™s perfect. Iâ€™m scared that the phone I suggest might not be the right one. I care about their decision especially if Iâ€™m helping them make that decision.</p>

<p>It took me a while to apply this to my job. Iâ€™m currently on a path to turn all my demos into conversations. I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™ve mastered this art but I wanted to share what Iâ€™m doing to get there:</p>

<h2 id="dont-just-be-a-product-expert-be-a-domain-expert">Donâ€™t just be a product expert, be a domain expert</h2>

<p>Product knowledge is overrated. Develop domain expertise and truly become a consultant. Read blogs, watch videos and most importantly â€” talk to people and learn from their experience.</p>

<p>Your prospects should learn things from you that they canâ€™t learn from Google</p>

<h2 id="be-genuinely-interested-in-your-prospect">Be genuinely interested in your prospect</h2>

<p>You will not be able to suggest the best solution if you donâ€™t care about what your prospects do(leave alone their problems). Be interested to find out what they do, how they run the show and where theyâ€™re facing challenges.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t listen to them because itâ€™s your job. Listen to them because you want to.</p>

<h2 id="learn-from-every-product-conversation">Learn from every product conversation</h2>

<p>Every conversation with your prospect is a great chance to learn about what they do. Itâ€™s an indirect way to build domain expertise. Always look for new things to learn.</p>

<h2 id="avoid-your-language-talk-their-language">Avoid your language, talk their language</h2>

<p>You know your product like the back of your hand. Your prospects are looking at it for the first time. Thereâ€™s a BIG gap. A â€˜demoâ€™ is not the time to show off your product knowledge. My target before every first product conversation is to not use a single word from my product.</p>

<h2 id="lastly-be-honest">Lastly, be honest</h2>

<p>A product conversation is one of the first interactions between you and a prospect. If you know that something will not work, say it wonâ€™t work. Leaving them hanging unnecessarily only to get back with a negative response will contribute to bad customer experience.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m ending this article with a plea. Letâ€™s start scheduling Product Conversations from now on. A purpose of a demo can be met through a 5 minute video. A conversation can deliver much more value and it needs a human-a Sales Engineer. What do you choose?</p>

<p>Happy demoing-oops, happy conversations!</p>
