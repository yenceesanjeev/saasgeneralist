I"L<p>Structured learning (courses, workshops &amp; guidebooks, not webinars, blogs, popular books or podcasts) is under-appreciated, even discouraged.</p>

<p>They’re expensive, require long term commitment and don’t enjoy the same attention as shorter content pieces (nothing against them).</p>

<p>Our education system does a really good job of associating a negative connotation to “learning”. It’s a rote learning method that doesn’t focus on applications or examples.</p>

<p>We also assume that we can “learn on the job” and even convince ourselves that it’s the best way. There are enough examples around us, as well.</p>

<p>Invest in the right classes, courses or books for</p>

<p>1) Curriculum driven learning
A good curriculum neatly arranges the learning material so that one builds on top of the other. Accelerates your learning.</p>

<p>2) A proper intro to a topic, rather than plunging into it
Imagine learning calculus without knowing basic math. You’ll eventually figure out basic math but wouldn’t it have been faster if you had known basic math?</p>

<p>3) You learn from the world
When you learn on the job, your learnings are limited to those around you.</p>

<p>I also personally enjoy the exams at the end! ;)</p>

<p>There are many bad options out there, so do your research before picking the right ones.</p>
