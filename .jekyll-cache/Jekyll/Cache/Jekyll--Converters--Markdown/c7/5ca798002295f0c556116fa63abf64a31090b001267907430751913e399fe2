I"“<p>Thereâ€™s a difference between quick decision making and reckless decision making</p>

<p>Quick decision makers</p>
<ul>
  <li>considers necessary parameters</li>
  <li>consults necessary stakeholders</li>
  <li>owns up bad decisions, even with lack of time</li>
  <li>delays decision making, if it can cause harm</li>
  <li>thinks about communication while making a decision</li>
</ul>

<p>Reckless decision makers</p>
<ul>
  <li>considers parameters that come to mind first</li>
  <li>consults whoever is available</li>
  <li>blames a bad decision on lack of time</li>
  <li>goes ahead with a bad decision, citing a deadline</li>
  <li>communication is an after thought</li>
</ul>

<p>Quick decision making is dependent on how quickly youâ€™re able to process the different parameters and only consider the ones that are absolutely necessary for decision making. Itâ€™s almost like MVP of decision making.</p>
