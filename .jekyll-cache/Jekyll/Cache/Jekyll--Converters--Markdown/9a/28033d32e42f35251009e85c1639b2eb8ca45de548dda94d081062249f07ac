I"ç<p>Hello there, I‚Äôm Mr.Customer.</p>

<p>I have a need. I have time to spare. More importantly, I have money that I can spend on a solution that will cater to my needs. Like most in my breed, I evaluated a few products before deciding on the one that I believed would help me. What follows is my experience of interacting with the people from my chosen product. A SaaS product.</p>

<p>An energetic young gentleman called Mr.SalesRep from the product company was my single point of contact during the evaluation period. If I was stuck anywhere, I‚Äôd just email him and he would respond.</p>

<p>He and another smart fellow, Mr.SalesEngineer helped solve most of my issues. They fully understand how my business runs and what I‚Äôm trying to achieve.</p>

<p>I just gave him the happy news that I‚Äôve chosen their product. He was jubilant. Now, it‚Äôs just the matter of how to get the payment across.</p>
