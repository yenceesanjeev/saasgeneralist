I"œ<p>Use mindmaps as a thinking tool if youâ€™re struggling on a word document.</p>

<p>Most of us default to word documents or excel sheets when we want to ideate. (If you use notebooks, youâ€™re already better than most of us)</p>

<p>These tools were never designed for capturing ideas, hence</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your energy mostly goes into formatting and alignment</li>
  <li>You find the raw version too raw to share with anyone else</li>
  <li>There are too many ways to structure it (Bullet points, merged rows etc) and hence lacks a flow</li>
</ul>

<p>Try mindmaps as an alternative. Itâ€™s perfect for those messy thoughts that need to be branched and grouped together. Mindmaps also minimise word usage, always good.</p>

<p>You can also easily share it with people by simply taking a photo of it and itâ€™s instantly understood. There are tools (I personally enjoy Whimsical) but good old pen and paper would do!</p>
