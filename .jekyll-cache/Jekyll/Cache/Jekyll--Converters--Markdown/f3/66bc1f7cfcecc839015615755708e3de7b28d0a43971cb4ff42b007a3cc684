I"N<p>Never get emotionally attached with your own work. What you think of it doesn’t matter. In a business context, you’re not always the target audience.</p>

<p>Signs of emotional attachment:</p>

<p>1) Leading opening statements
“This is my best work so far” [Too early to call]
“I love what I’ve done!” [Do the audience love it?]</p>

<p>2) Defensive arguments from a personal POV/without data
“Our audience will love this” [Assumption, not data driven]
“Someone on the other team loved this” [Someone is not target audience]</p>

<p>3) Incoherent correlation
“This is how we did it last time, it worked” [Parameters have changed]
“Our CEO/Manager prefers this style” [Different context]</p>

<p>I think about it from an art vs design standpoint. By design, I mean everything from a piece of code to a microcopy.</p>

<p>Art is vague &amp; subjective, you always don’t have a goal. It may or may not appeal to majority of your audience. Success lies in audience reach (maybe, maybe not). Personal satisfaction matters.</p>

<p>Design is specific and definitive, you have a goal to achieve. It NEEDS to appeal to majority of your audience. Success lies is business results. Personal satisfaction doesn’t matter (debatable)</p>

<p>Run micro experiments and let business results measure your work, not personal opinions</p>
