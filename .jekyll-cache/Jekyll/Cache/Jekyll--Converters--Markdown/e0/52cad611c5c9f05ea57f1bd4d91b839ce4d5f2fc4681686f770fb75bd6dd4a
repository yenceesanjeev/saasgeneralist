I"F<p>In great teams, you’re rarely able to credit an individual for an idea. It belongs to the team.</p>

<p>It truly emerges from collective intelligence where everyone builds on top of each other. This is possible when different skilled individuals come at it with varied expertise, different perspectives but aligned on the same vision. And trust. Of course, trust.</p>

<p>In the end, the original thought is almost unrecognisable but the team is left with a great idea. It’s in these kind of teams that everyone’s equally motivated to see that idea through to success.</p>
