I"Î<p>The not so common but useful things you can do before, during and after a meeting</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Check the attendees calendar to see if they are coming from a meeting/have a meeting to go to. Plan accordingly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Share an agenda, yes. But donâ€™t reveal /everything/ you want to discuss ahead of time. Especially unconventional ideas. Set context in person.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If itâ€™s a comfortable topic, walk up to the whiteboard and start writing down important discussion points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If youâ€™re too shy/scared to walk out of a meeting where youâ€™re not needed, just open your laptop/notebook and start working on something else. No point in wasting mental energy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If youâ€™re trying too hard to make a point and it gets shot down many times, let it go. You can always go back and send an email with more structured thoughts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For important meetings, block 45 minutes of buffer time after the meeting. Multiple benefits. Hallway conversations, being the biggest one</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take personal notes as well, not just meeting notes. If youâ€™re new to a company, take notes to understand each personsâ€™ motivation, affinity towards ideas and philosophy/beliefs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you can type fast, send a neatly formatted meeting summary before everyone steps out of the room. This is a big flex. Sounds hard but isnâ€™t.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
