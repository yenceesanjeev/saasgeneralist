I"r<p>If you really want to grow within an organisation, you have to continuously make yourself redundant.</p>

<p>Sounds very counter intuitive, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Hoarding information, power, responsibility is sometimes an instinctive reaction. You don’t want to share that document, you don’t want to add someone to a meeting, you don’t want to discuss your idea until it’s done but if you don’t do that - you might be stuck forever in that loop, doing the same things over and over again.</p>

<p>Start letting go of things slowly once you’re comfortable. Newer things will start falling on your plate. Bigger things, maybe.</p>

<p>Always look for ways to make yourself redundant.</p>

<p>Are you the go-to person on your team? Train someone to be that person
Building a super insightful report every week? Automate it
Learnt a new skill that benefits the team? Teach everyone else
Do a training every month? Train 5 other trainers
Only you know how to resolve a specific bug? Document and share</p>

<p>This will ensure that there’s no dependancy on you and THAT gives you the space to keep expanding and growing!</p>
