I"Ô<p>Remote working is a conscious choice, both from the employer and the employee. That means, both parties are prepared and equipped to work remotely and manage remotely</p>

<p>What weâ€™re undergoing right now is a knee jerk reaction to the fact that we CANNOT work in an office. Very different from remote working. This is at best work-from-home at scale</p>

<p>Most managers right now are thrown into this situation and theyâ€™ve only managed teams in offices before. The same rules donâ€™t apply here.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s completely fine to accept the fact that we need time to reorient. Itâ€™s better than pretending to understand what remote working is. Itâ€™s not just working from home, itâ€™s much more than that.</p>
