I"2<p>Why I prefer posting on social media over writing a blog post</p>

<p>Most of my ideas/thoughts are either Twitter threads or long Linkedin posts. Hereâ€™s why</p>

<p>1) Easier to consume.
Blog posts are at least one click away. Most of the time, I bookmark articles and never get to them. Social media posts can be consumed as you scroll through</p>

<p>2) Easier to publish.
I donâ€™t have to worry about editing, formatting, SEO, cover image. Nothing. Just write. Post. Thatâ€™s all.</p>

<p>3) Better engagement.
When was the last time you commented on a blog post? The things I share are based on my perspectives and therefore Iâ€™m very interested in hearing other perspectives. Social media is better to invite other people to the conversation</p>

<p>4) Harder to ramble
I ramble. The word limit on these platforms forces me to write concisely and include only whatâ€™s necessary</p>

<p>5) Wider reach
Social media platforms (Especially Linkedin) promote their own content over links from other platform</p>

<p>There are significant downsides to publishing ONLY on social media. Hard to recover older posts. Shorter life span for content. Cannot be discovered via Google.</p>

<p>I wish I could turn these all into full fledged blog posts but if I wait for that, then they would forever remain in my drafts ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
