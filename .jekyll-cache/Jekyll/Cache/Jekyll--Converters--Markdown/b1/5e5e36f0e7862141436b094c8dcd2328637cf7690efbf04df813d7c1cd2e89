I"ÿ<p>Managers must take responsibility for the team members, not just the team deliverables</p>

<p>Itâ€™s obvious that a manager is responsible for the teamsâ€™ deliverables. Theyâ€™re responsible for the outcomes, quality of the output and ensuring deadlines are met. But is that all theyâ€™re responsible for?</p>

<p>If you ask me, the team members are responsible for the deliverables. The manager should simply be responsible for the team members, their growth and morale. The deliverables will follow.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re a manager, are these questions keeping you up at night?</p>

<p>Are my team members happy?
Are they learning something new?
Do they feel valued in the organisation?
Do they feel like theyâ€™re growing?
Am I giving them constant feedback?
Am I coaching them?
Am I having enough 1-on-1 conversations with them?
Do they understand individual/team/company goals?
Are they comfortable speaking up?
Am I nudging them outside their comfort levels?
Are they getting enough interaction opportunities outside the team?
Are they excited about work?
Do they have visibility into what I do?
Are they good enough to replace me?
Can I promote them and get out of the way?</p>

<p>If youâ€™re worried about this, then the team will worry about the deliverables :)</p>
