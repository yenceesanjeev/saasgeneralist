I"-<p>Are critical feedback conversations with your team uncomfortable? That’s probably because you haven’t appreciated them enough</p>

<p>An appreciation culture will earn you the right to give critical feedback as often as you want to because when delivered in tandem, it simply becomes ‘feedback’.</p>

<p>How do you foster an appreciation culture?</p>

<p>1) Appreciate small things, doesn’t cost much
A good support reply, great blog title, brilliant choice of colors, useful comments in the code - these are small things that often go unappreciated.</p>

<p>2) Appreciate asynchronously
Don’t wait till 1on1s to appreciate. Leave google doc comments, send short emails/texts, leave positive voice notes or maybe even social media replies.</p>

<p>3) DON’T appreciate mediocrity
Appreciating culture doesn’t mean you appreciate for the sake of appreciation. It’s simply to foster a culture of appreciating things that are worthy but often ignored.</p>

<p>The moment you repeatedly appreciate a person for their positive behavior, critical feedback won’t seem out of place.</p>

<p>If you only single out their flaws everytime (even with good intentions), they tend to fixate on that. They think “Why does every conversation seem to be about what I can improve? Am I not doing anything right?”</p>
