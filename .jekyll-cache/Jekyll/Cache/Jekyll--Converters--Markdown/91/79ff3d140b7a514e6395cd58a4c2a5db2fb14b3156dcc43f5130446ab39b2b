I"ª<p>My 5 rules for Linkedin</p>

<p>I will never share anything if it doesnâ€™t add value</p>
<ul>
  <li>Value = new information/insight/perspective, aggregation of old information, link to valuable content, make you laugh</li>
  <li>No promotions, no inspiring quotes</li>
</ul>

<p>I will avoid sharing minor personal glories/updates</p>
<ul>
  <li>EOD, Linkedin is a social platform and hence it makes sense to keep your network updated for major updates
-No team change alerts, No screenshots of appreciation emails</li>
</ul>

<p>I will never talk about things I havenâ€™t done/directly observed</p>
<ul>
  <li>Knowledge comes from doing (or directly observing) over a period of time. Otherwise, Iâ€™m not qualified to talk about it.</li>
  <li>No commentary about world news</li>
</ul>

<p>I will never DM anyone asking to like, comment, share my content</p>
<ul>
  <li>Biggest pet peeve. This shouldnâ€™t even be a rule but itâ€™s a common behavior. This may yield results but I donâ€™t have the courage to do it</li>
</ul>

<p>I will always stand to be corrected</p>
<ul>
  <li>I will share perspectives/opinions I strongly believe in. They are my views, not necessarily the right ones. If an opposing view is presented with valid points, I will eat my words.</li>
  <li>No staunch stances, no unreasonable arguments.</li>
</ul>

<p>These rules evolved over time, it may not directly apply to you. Call me out if Iâ€™m not abiding by them</p>
