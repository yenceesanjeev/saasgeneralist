I"ù<p>Donâ€™t exist on social media only as a broadcast channel for your employer</p>

<p>While amplifying that message may seem required, people will soon start tuning you out.</p>

<p>Take a stance, have an opinion. Be original. Disagree. Support other great ideas. Brainstorm. Crack a joke. Maybe, share a meme or comic (not too often). Talk outside your domain. Find new people. Rant, itâ€™s okay sometimes. Ask questions. Share mistakes. Post draft articles.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a lot more to do here</p>
