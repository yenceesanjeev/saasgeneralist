<p>Viral ‚Äî need to resonate with your target audience.</p>

<h1 id="target-keywords">Target keywords</h1>

<p>Biggest blogging mistake ‚Äî writing about things no one is searching for.</p>

<p>Blog = Traffic = Audience = Sales</p>

<p>Google is the single source for the blog</p>

<p>Write about things that are relevant to your potential buyers</p>

<p>The first result will get 30% of all clicks</p>

<p>Search volume for a single keyword is not the only indicator, there are some similar search volume results that could be helpful.</p>

<p>Total search traffic more important than traffic for a single keyword.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-find-the-best-keywords-to-target">How to find the BEST keywords to target</h1>

<p>Put yourself in the shoes of the audience</p>

<p>Guess what they might be looking for</p>

<p>Put that in a tool like ahrefs</p>

<p>Look at the top-ranking page result</p>

<p>Title your article similar to that as well</p>

<h1 id="how-to-determine-the-ranking-difficulty-in-google">How to determine the ranking difficulty in Google</h1>

<p>No one really knows how Google ranks pages</p>

<p>Two factors ‚Äî On-page + incoming links</p>

<p>Behavioral factors also matter ‚Äî How long ppl stay? Do they do something?</p>

<p>More websites that link to your page, it‚Äôll rank in your results.</p>

<p>Backlink factors had the most correlation to high search result ranking</p>

<p>When you want to outrank an article, note down the number of backlinks. Identify the one with the least backlinks so you can easily outrank them.</p>

<p>Spam vs Outreach ‚Äî Keep away from both ends of the spectrum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Don‚Äôt reach out to too many people by blasting emails</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don‚Äôt spend too much time &amp; research before sending out personal outreach email</p>

<p><strong>Group 1:</strong></p>

<p>People who have linked to existing articles on the same topic</p>

<p>Search in Google, Find a topic, find backlinks (Referring domains, dofollow, ‚Äúlook for domain names that make sense‚Äù</p>

<p>Content explorer, look for a topic.</p>

<p>Filter referring domains, sort by high to low referring domains</p>

<p>Group 2:</p>

<p>People who publish article that mention your topic and reach out for backlink. Use alerts to be informed when someone else mentions that topics</p>

<p>Group 3:</p>

<p>People who tweeted articles on the topic.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt reach out to them through email, reply to the tweet with something engaging. It‚Äôs social media engagement strategy</p>

<h1 id="writing-great-outreach-emails">Writing great outreach emails</h1>

<p>Reach out and you could say they‚Äôre linking to an outdated article. What‚Äôs in it for them? Why should they read your email? Answer that first. Focus on them and not on yourself!</p>

<p>3 Common outreach excuses</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Your article provides a fresh angle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mention that fresh angle in the email, don‚Äôt make them find it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your article some new and unique proof that strengthens their stand</p>

    <p>You‚Äôve featured their work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They‚Äôll atleast reply and say thanks.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>How to persuade them to link to your article?</p>
