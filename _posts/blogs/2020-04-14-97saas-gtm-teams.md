I’m not particularly proud of this but my previous [blog post](https://www.saasgeneralist.com/post/how-it-feels-to-be-a-saas-customer-in-2016) on the same topic was kind of a rant. Hence, I decided to be productive on this one and propose a solution to the problem: Too many people reaching out to customers in a SaaS world.



## How it works right now

Well, how do we solve a problem without defining it first? Well here’s how it works right now.

All that clutter, yes. See why I ranted? With so many people reaching out to the customer, we’re setting ourselves up for miscommunication. In a set up like this, bad customer experience is a disaster waiting to happen.



Let me quickly define what each of them does.



_**Sales rep:**_ _- The first person to reach out to the prospect_ _- Understands the need — suggest the right solution. Identify product fit_ _- Go to person for commercial/pricing_

_**Sales Engineer/Pre Sales**_ _- Demos the product and showcases value to the prospect_ _- Configures workflow and helps set up a Proof-Of-Concept_ _-_ Go-to _person for all tech assistance before_ the _sales cycle_

_**Technical Account Manager:**_ _**-**_ _Single technical point of contact for the customer(ex-prospect)_ _- Manages the product technically_ _- Goto person to understand how the customer’s product is configured — technically_ _- If not available,_ the s_upport team will step in_

_**Customer Success:**_ _**-**Proactively reaches out to understand current customer scenario_ _-Reviews product usage and suggests_ the _best possible ways to improve product adoption_ _-Goto person to understand current customer pulse/emotion_

_**Account Manager:**_ _**-**_ _Responsible for managing key accounts and identifying growth opportunities_ _- Proactively reaches out_ _- Goto person to understand if there’s potential to expand product usage across different teams/geographies or scale the current team_





# The proposed model

Now, I’m suggesting bringing all of that into just two people: Sales + Support.

saas GTM proposed model

Yes. Simple & Neat. That’s it.



Well, how about other teams? Let me explain how all the roles kind of merge into either Sales or Support.



_**The new Sales:**_ _**-**_ _Takes up part of the Sales Engineer’s role of demoing the product, showcasing_ the _value and suggesting workflows_ _- Works with Support to set up a Proof-Of-Concept if required_ _- Constantly engages with the customer to identify growth opportunities thus eliminating the need for a separate Account Manager_

_**The new Support:**_ _**-**_ _Provides Technical support to Sales during the evaluation phase eliminating the need or a Sales Engineer_ _- Sets up workflows and the product_ pre-sales _and manages it_ post-sales _- Proactively reaches out to understand product usage and suggest ways to improve product usage_ _- Works with Sales on new growth opportunities if they come up_



## What are the potential advantages?

**Minimal or No information loss:** Customers get annoyed when they have to repeat themselves. Workflows and technical information are the ones likely to get lost during Pre to Post sales transition. This can be fully eliminated as it’s the same person setting it up.

**Better Customer experience:** Customers work a lot with SalesEngineer and Sales to explain their business needs and set things up the way they want it. Once the Sales cycle ends, they’re forced to give up on the relationship and suddenly work with a new set of people. Customers can work with the same set of people right from the point of evaluation until they leave(or not)

**No room for miscommunication:** The more people you put between people and people, the more chances of miscommunication. It can lead to a bad experience on both the customer and the employee side. Teams tend to exist within silos and it takes a huge effort to break them down. Fewer teams, fewer silos, lesser effort.

## Ideal candidates

So, what kind of people should you be looking for?



_**Sales:**_ _- Strong communication /relationship building skills_ _- Strong Problem solving skills_ _- Good business/industry knowledge_ _- A true consultant_

_**Support:**_ _- Strong technical/domain skills_ _- Decent communication_ _- Empathetic, patient and friendly_ _- Ability to preempt problems_



## Potential objections

Of course, a new method, a new approach. Things aren’t going to be easy. I’ve tried to answer FAQs on this approach.

**Won’t my Sales bandwidth reduce if they’re working on demos as well?** A simple answer to that would be to add more people to the team. Think about it. When the leads increase, you add people to the Sales team and when you grow the Sales team, you add people to the Pre Sales team. Now, you’re just adding people 1 team instead of two.

**If my Sales team is engaging with old customers, how can we get new revenue?** Not always. It will majorly be the Support team that engages with the customer and the Sales team will only engage with them from time to time — proactively. It’s always better to keep in touch with your customers and who knows: if you keep them happy, they might get you a bunch of new referrals. Earlier, 1 account manager used to do it for about 3 Sales Reps leads. I’m just proposing everyone does Account management for their own accounts.

The above model is just an idea and may not be fully scalable. It might sound silly but who knows, maybe that’s what people think initially when unconventional ideas are brought up :)
