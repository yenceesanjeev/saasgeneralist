_Disclaimer: The learnings are from this course ‚Äî_ [_Blogging for Business_](https://ahrefs.com/academy/blogging-for-business)_. I highly encourage everyone to take the course for full learnings. I took down these notes for myself. Sharing it here to see if a wider audience benefit from it_

# One big takeaway from the course

> _Blogging for business is different from blogging for passion._

The fundamental rule of content marketing ‚Äî **‚ÄúYour content should be of high quality, else everything else will fail‚Äù**

# Why did I take this course?

Learn to convert blog visitors to customers Learn more about SEO Learn how to turn my passion for writing into tangible business outcomes

# What did I learn from this course?

-   Write about things relevant to your potential buyers

-   Use keyword research extensively [ahrefs]

-   Outreach for backlinks, not for views

-   Publishing X number of articles per week is a nonsense goal

-   Backlinks are important to rank high in Google results


# EXHAUSTIVE NOTES:

# Lesson 1: The compound effect of content marketing

# Why blog?

Search, inbound.

Also, word of mouth, through sharing on social.

Content is a great way to generate word of mouth.

# Why do blogs fail?

Spike of hope ‚Äî after sharing on social and distribution, it‚Äôll spike but it‚Äôll fall after that.

Publishing new content regularly will have a curvy growth. /\/\/\/\

It needs to grow consistently. Upward growthüìà

Ahrefs publish 2‚Äì3 blogs per month and their traffic grow regularly. They used to publish 2‚Äì3 blogs per week and it wasn‚Äôt growing.

Important to drive traffic to the business and actually impact revenue.

Consistent traffic to the blog is more important than the periodic spikes

# How a blog grows

-   Spike of hope denotes that you‚Äôre asking the existing audience to come back to your blog

-   Sharing it in communities will also not bring new articles.

-   Word of mouth is passive. Publishing great content will generate word of mouth.

-   Proactive word of mouth can be achieved by emailing influencers.


# Lesson 2: Two major strategies of growing a blog

# Strategies to grow a blog

Viral ‚Äî need to resonate with your target audience.

SEO ‚Äî need to be useful, get backlinks, don‚Äôt have to publish regularly

Viral traffic doesn‚Äôt grow 1x, 2x, 3x, not snowball effect.

Content only goes viral if only exposed to a SUPER HUGE audience

Just one tweet from influencer doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll get picked up

Possible to build your entire business around a single article.

# Lesson 3: How to analyze the traffic potential and ranking difficulty of a keyword

# Target keywords

Biggest blogging mistake ‚Äî writing about things no one is searching for.

Blog = Traffic = Audience = Sales

Google is the single source for the blog

Write about things that are relevant to your potential buyers

The first result will get 30% of all clicks

Search volume for a single keyword is not the only indicator, there are some similar search volume results that could be helpful.

Total search traffic more important than traffic for a single keyword.

# How to find the BEST keywords to target

Put yourself in the shoes of the audience

Guess what they might be looking for

Put that in a tool like ahrefs

Look at the top-ranking page result

Title your article similar to that as well

# How to determine the ranking difficulty in Google

No one really knows how Google ranks pages

Two factors ‚Äî On-page + incoming links

Behavioral factors also matter ‚Äî How long ppl stay? Do they do something?

More websites that link to your page, it‚Äôll rank in your results.

Backlink factors had the most correlation to high search result ranking

When you want to outrank an article, note down the number of backlinks. Identify the one with the least backlinks so you can easily outrank them.

# Lesson 4: How to find great content ideas with high business value

# How to source great ideas:

Find communities like LinkedIn groups, Subreddits, Slack groups

Identify topics and figure out the search volume

# Keyword research tools

Look for what people search for.

answerthepublic.com

ubersuggest.io

Google Keyword planner ‚Äî not very great from SEO planners

# Keywords for competition

Site explorer ‚Äî search for your top keyword and look at google, what other companies come there? Search for it on Site explorer in ahrefs

Go to top pages

# How to find low competition keywords?

Use content explorer in ahrefs, search for the keyword

Domain ranking is high, could depend on backlinks

Referring domain is backlinks

# How to prioritize content ideas

Assess based on business value ‚Äî will a reader become a customer?

3 ‚Äî very useful

2 ‚Äî helpful, but not directly relevant

1 ‚Äî very weak but relevant

Topics with huge traffic potential < topics with huge business potential

Hubspot‚Äôs top article is ‚ÄúHow to make a GIF‚Äù ‚Äî 0 Business value

Search volume != business potential

# Lesson 5: How to optimize your article for a target keyword and generate maximum search traffic with it

# Searcher Intent

Targeting the wrong keyword could be a mistake?

Target the keyword with the right searcher intent, not the highest search volume

‚Äúadvertising research‚Äù vs ‚ÄúPPC advertising research‚Äù

Pick the most relevant keyword even if the search volume is low

# Optimizing articles for the keyword

If the article content matches the searcher intent, then that‚Äôs 80% of the optimization

75% of top 2M searches don‚Äôt have the search keyword in their page at all

Keyword stuffing won‚Äôt work anymore

Use keyword in Title, URL, Content

Google allows flexibility, it can understand synonyms and don‚Äôt have to be an exact match

# Max results for your article

Your article ranks for more than 1 search query

Naturally, rewrite the article to mention more relevant search queries

Look for the **content gap** between top-ranking articles but you don‚Äôt have.

Study what people are searching for and expand your article to include that

# Blog audit

You can outrank the competition by updating your old content. Your past articles might be targeting the wrong keyword

Go through blogs and assign them to:

-   Update

-   Articles that already bring search

-   Action: Update articles or competition will outrank you

-   Merge

-   On the same topic

-   Use 301 redirects

-   Research on 301 redirects

-   Delete articles that don‚Äôt bring any traffic


# Lesson 6. How to create great content that promotes itself

How to grow domain ratings?

Create content with backlinks ‚Äî internal links to unpopular pages.

# Lesson 10: How to build links & promote content via blogger outreach

# Outreach for Content Promotion

Don‚Äôt treat outreach as a failure if you didn‚Äôt get any tweets or backlinks. You are still promoting the blog

Spam vs Outreach ‚Äî Keep away from both ends of the spectrum:

-   Don‚Äôt reach out to too many people by blasting emails

-   Don‚Äôt spend too much time & research before sending out personal outreach email


Experiment to optimise Open Rate, Clicks rate and Reply rate.

# How to find quality prospects for outreach

Building links should the primary intent of outreach.

**Group 1:**

People who have linked to existing articles on the same topic

Search in Google, Find a topic, find backlinks (Referring domains, dofollow, ‚Äúlook for domain names that make sense‚Äù

Content explorer, look for a topic.

Filter referring domains, sort by high to low referring domains

Group 2:

People who publish article that mention your topic and reach out for backlink. Use alerts to be informed when someone else mentions that topics

Group 3:

People who tweeted articles on the topic.

Don‚Äôt reach out to them through email, reply to the tweet with something engaging. It‚Äôs social media engagement strategy

# Writing great outreach emails

Reach out and you could say they‚Äôre linking to an outdated article. What‚Äôs in it for them? Why should they read your email? Answer that first. Focus on them and not on yourself!

3 Common outreach excuses

1.  Your article provides a fresh angle

2.  Mention that fresh angle in the email, don‚Äôt make them find it

3.  Your article some new and unique proof that strengthens their stand

4.  You‚Äôve featured their work

5.  They‚Äôll atleast reply and say thanks.


How to persuade them to link to your article?

There‚Äôs no real proper way. Don‚Äôt ask them directly.

‚ÄúIf you find it useful, maybe you can even link it to your article‚Äù

Don‚Äôt be pushy.

Your CONTENT should do the job of persuading them to link to it.

Don‚Äôt send a lot of follow-ups. Follow ups could do a lot more harm than good
