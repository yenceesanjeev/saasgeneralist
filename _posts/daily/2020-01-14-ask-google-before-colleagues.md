There's a difference between quick decision making and reckless decision making

Quick decision makers
- considers necessary parameters
- consults necessary stakeholders
- owns up bad decisions, even with lack of time
- delays decision making, if it can cause harm
- thinks about communication while making a decision

Reckless decision makers
- considers parameters that come to mind first
- consults whoever is available
- blames a bad decision on lack of time
- goes ahead with a bad decision, citing a deadline
- communication is an after thought

Quick decision making is dependent on how quickly you're able to process the different parameters and only consider the ones that are absolutely necessary for decision making. It's almost like MVP of decision making.
