Use mindmaps as a thinking tool if you're struggling on a word document.

Most of us default to word documents or excel sheets when we want to ideate. (If you use notebooks, you're already better than most of us)

These tools were never designed for capturing ideas, hence

- Your energy mostly goes into formatting and alignment
- You find the raw version too raw to share with anyone else
- There are too many ways to structure it (Bullet points, merged rows etc) and hence lacks a flow

Try mindmaps as an alternative. It's perfect for those messy thoughts that need to be branched and grouped together. Mindmaps also minimise word usage, always good.

You can also easily share it with people by simply taking a photo of it and it's instantly understood. There are tools (I personally enjoy Whimsical) but good old pen and paper would do!
