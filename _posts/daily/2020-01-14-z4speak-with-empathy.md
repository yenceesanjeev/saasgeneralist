"How's it going?" > "Is it done?"
"I built on top of it" > "I made changes to it"
"I noticed something" > "There's a mistake"
"Need more time?" > "Today was the deadline"
"Need some help with it?" > "Gentle reminder"
"Sharing this will lead to..." > "Don't share this"
"Was this intentional?" > "Did you proofread this?"
"Take care of the situation" > "Clean up the mess"
"This is not your best work" > "This can be better"
"Need your help to unblock us" > "Bumping this up"
"We were waiting for you" > "We started without you"
"I need it before the board meeting" > "I need it today"
"This activity is blocked" > "I've been waiting for a week"
"Let me get you caught up" > "You missed the last meeting"
"Are you adding the examples?" > "Where are the examples?"
