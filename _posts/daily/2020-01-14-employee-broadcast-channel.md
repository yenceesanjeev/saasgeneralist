Don't exist on social media only as a broadcast channel for your employer

While amplifying that message may seem required, people will soon start tuning you out.

Take a stance, have an opinion. Be original. Disagree. Support other great ideas. Brainstorm. Crack a joke. Maybe, share a meme or comic (not too often). Talk outside your domain. Find new people. Rant, it's okay sometimes. Ask questions. Share mistakes. Post draft articles.

There's a lot more to do here
