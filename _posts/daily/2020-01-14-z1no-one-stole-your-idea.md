No one stole your idea, you were just too lazy to execute it

Yes, you're brilliant for coming up with it. If you don't see it through, it doesn't help anything except make you feel good about it. There's no real value in keeping things inside your head.

Get comfortable with the fact that someone else will eventually end up executing the same idea (Not "YOUR" idea, but the same idea) because they cared enough to do something about it.

Even when you come up with your own unique ideas, it's necessary for you to lend your ideas to others for them to run with it. For the greater good. You may not have the time, or the skillsets to execute them. Be okay with it.

Don't fall into the trap of "My idea, my rules." You get so attached to an idea that you're not able to appreciate the outcome when someone else executes it. At the end of the day, if an idea benefits the organisation that's all that matters.

There are times where you'll be required to completely let go o an idea for someone on your team to execute it. The best leaders are the ones who feed ideas to their team without them realising it. It takes an exceptional leader to feed an idea and stand back to see someone on the team run with it, like their own.

Very easy to say, I know ðŸ˜€
