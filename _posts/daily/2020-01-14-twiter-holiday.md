Hello there, I’m Mr.Customer.

I have a need. I have time to spare. More importantly, I have money that I can spend on a solution that will cater to my needs. Like most in my breed, I evaluated a few products before deciding on the one that I believed would help me. What follows is my experience of interacting with the people from my chosen product. A SaaS product.

An energetic young gentleman called Mr.SalesRep from the product company was my single point of contact during the evaluation period. If I was stuck anywhere, I’d just email him and he would respond.



He and another smart fellow, Mr.SalesEngineer helped solve most of my issues. They fully understand how my business runs and what I’m trying to achieve.

I just gave him the happy news that I’ve chosen their product. He was jubilant. Now, it’s just the matter of how to get the payment across.
