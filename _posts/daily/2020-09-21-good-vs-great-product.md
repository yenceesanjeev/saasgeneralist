Avoid certifications, if you can. They're expensive and not always indicative of your knowledge on the topic

Do certifications:

- If it's mandatory for a job

- If your employer is paying for it

- You have dispensable cash and need an insignificant trophy for your learning

If you really want to learn, try:

- Go on YouTube and search for the topic

- Read books that are recommended by great thinkers in that domain

- Follow people who are doing what you want to learn

Certificates give you a false sense of accomplishment but that's only short term.

#Learning is never finite, it should never feel "done"
