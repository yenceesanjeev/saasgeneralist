# SaaS Generalist
URL - [Live Website](https://saasgeneralist.com)

SaaS Generalist is a website built on top of [Reked Jekyll theme](https://jekyll-themes.com/reked/)

# My Additions/Modifications

## Bytes pages
URL - https://saasgeneralist.com/bytes/
A page for 1 minute reads and snippets that's easy to consume at a glance. 

### Approach
- Blog posts go under the blog folder
- Byte posts go under the daily folder

Filtered only the bytes posts under the URL

## Tweets page
Added a Tweets page to showcase some of my tweets.  

### Approach
Saved the tweet ids in a tweets.csv file
Looped through the file to generate the tweets on the page

Note: This page won't be rendered on mobile because the page load time is extremely high
[] Need to learn how to load only 3 tweets and load everything else on click

# About
