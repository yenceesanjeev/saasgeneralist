header: What is SaaS Generalist?

I have a vision.

To build more generalists in the Indian SaaS ecosystem, especially among those in their early career.

Traditional career wisdom forces us to be specalists. We have more than enough reasons to beleive that generalists are far more successful when they form unique mental models with what they know.

Today, saasgeneralist.com is simply a blog where I document my ideas. But it can be much bigger.

If this vision resonates with you, send me an email at yenceesanjeev@gmail.com. Let's do something.
